# Wine Quality Predictor

The Wine Quality Predictor is a web application built using Flask that predicts the quality of a wine based on various chemical properties. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make the predictions.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface to input wine properties.
- Prediction of wine quality as either "High Quality" or "Low Quality".
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.
- Dark theme with smooth transitions and animations.
- Centrally aligned heading for better visual appeal.
- Input fields with clear placeholders and validation.
- Feedback messages for successful and failed predictions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- pandas
- numpy
- xgboost

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sanjaykohli/Wine-Quality-Predictor.git
Copy code
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Wine-Quality-Predictor
Copy code
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv env
Copy code
Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On Unix or macOS:
  ```
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy code
5. Run the Flask application:
python app.py
Copy code
6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to access the Wine Quality Predictor.

## Usage

1. Enter the required wine properties in the input fields:
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- Free Sulfur Dioxide
- Total Sulfur Dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

2. Click the "Predict" button.
3. The application will display the predicted quality of the wine as "High Quality" or "Low Quality".
4. If any input field is left blank or contains invalid data, an error message will be displayed, prompting the user to provide valid inputs.
