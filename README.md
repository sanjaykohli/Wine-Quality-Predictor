# Wine Quality Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using popular Python libraries.

## Dataset

The project uses the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, focusing on red wine.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed.
2. Run the `wine_quality_prediction.py` script.

## What it Does

1. Loads and explores the wine quality dataset.
2. Preprocesses the data for machine learning.
3. Trains several classification models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
4. Evaluates and compares model performance.
5. Visualizes results, including a confusion matrix and feature importances.
